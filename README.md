Food Classification

This script implements a food image classification model using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The script loads a pre-trained image classification model and trains it on a custom dataset of food images. The primary goal is to build a robust model capable of accurately categorizing food images. Key best practices employed include data augmentation with RandomResizedCrop and ToTensor transforms, careful memory management, and logging for debugging and monitoring. The model leverages a pre-trained transformer architecture for efficient feature extraction, significantly reducing training time and improving accuracy.
